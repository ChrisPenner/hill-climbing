Hill climbing algorithm using Store Comonads

This provides some fun functions for finding local maxima in simple topologies

`showSteps delta n t` will show `n` steps it takes towards the local maxima
checking the surrounding values displaced by `delta` orthogonally from the
current position as a nested tuple `((x, y), value)`

```haskell
Î»> showSteps 0.1 10 (buildTopology (0.3, 0.2))
[((0.3,0.2),0.2896295),((0.4,0.2),0.3816559),((0.5,0.2),0.46986896),((0.6,0.2),0.5533
